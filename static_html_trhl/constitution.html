<h3><a name="introduction"></a>A. Introduction</h3>
<p>The Three Run Homer League (TRHL) is an e-mail/internet based
simulation baseball league which uses Diamond Mind Baseball. </p>
<p>TRHL play began with the 1995 MLB season disk.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="philosophy"></a>B. Philosophy</h3>
<p>1. The TRHL is intended for the enjoyment of its members. Active
participation via the web page and message board is strongly encouraged.
Have fun.<br>
<br>
2. All members must have purchased the following:<br>
<br>
a) the Diamond Mind Baseball Game from Diamond Mind<br>
b) the current year player ratings from Diamond Mind<br>
<br>
Pirated copies are illegal.<br>
<br>
3. The overriding rule of the TRHL is the honor system. Whether it is
playing the games, managing your roster, dealing with other owners, or
any other league-related activity, honesty is required.<br>
<br>
4. There are no dues or fees to play in the TRHL. (All are encouraged,
however, to show some signs of gratitude toward those volunteers that
have made the TRHL the premier internet DMB league.)<br>
<br>
5. League membership considerations:<br>
<br>
a) If for any reason a manager should decide to leave the TRHL, please
inform the League Office so the team can be offered to someone else.<br>
<br>
b) If for any reason a temporary leave of absence is needed, please
inform the League Office. Arrangements can usually be made.<br>
<br>
c) Fanatical participation is encouraged (rants on the message board,
two dozen trade offers per day, etc). Minimal participation is required.<br>
<br>
Minimal participation is defined as:<br>
<br>
1) missing no more than 4 home series in a season<br>
2) missing no more than 2 home series before the all-star break<br>
3) consistently voting on league matters<br>
<br>
d. TRHL managers not adhering to 5.c.1-3 shall be subject to
replacement.<br>
<br>
e. TRHL managers not adhering to item B3 (the honor system), in the
opinion of the league majority, shall be subject to expulsion and deep
loathing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="governance"></a>C. Governance</h3>
<p>1. League Commissioner</p>
<p>The league shall be run by the League Commissioner. </p>
<p>a. The League Commissioner (Commissioner) shall serve one year
terms. Each term will begin immediately before the annual draft and end
immediately prior to the next annual draft.</p>
<p>b. Prior to the expiration of the Commissioner's term, an election
will be held to determine the next Commissioner. If the current
Commissioner desires to serve an additional term and no one decides to
run against him, no election is held.</p>
<p>c. The Commissioner has only the powers listed below:</p>
<p>1) appoint league officials and delegate powers and duties to them
as he sees fit;</p>
<p>2) set all schedules and deadlines;</p>
<p>3) resolve rule disputes;</p>
<p>4) resolve rule ambiguities, including any situations that are not
covered by the rules;</p>
<p>5) find and approve new team owners;</p>
<p>6) make minor rule changes, required for automation or streamlining
of procedures, provided such changes do not change the spirit of the
rules.</p>
<p>7) expel owners who do not comply with the rules.</p>
<p>d. The Commissioner has the following duties:</p>
<p>1) keep the league running in an efficient manner;</p>
<p>2) monitor voting for rule changes and Commissioner elections;</p>
<p>3) verify all team owners are using legal copies of DMB;</p>
<p>4) process each series file;</p>
<p>5) modify the Constitution, as necessary to incorporate all rule
changes that pass.</p>
<p>2. Rule Changes</p>
<p>When a rule change is proposed, the Commissioner shall allow a
sufficient time for discussion of the rule change. After that the
Commissioner shall put the proposed change to a vote. If more than half
the league votes for the change, then it passes and the Commissioner
then modifies the Constitution to incorporate the change.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="rules"></a>D. TRHL Rules</h3>
<p><a name="general"></a>1. General<br>
<br>
a) All rules are subject to interpretation by the TRHL Comissioner. <br>
<br>
b) Constitutional revisions are subject to a league-wide vote.<br>
<br>
<a name="leagues"></a>2.Leagues<br>
<br>
a) The THRL will have 2 leagues (National and American) each comprised
of 3 divisions, with 4 teams in each division. This is subject to change
as a result of future league expansion.<br>
<br>
b) The AL will employ the designated hitter option while the NL will
not.<br>
<br>
c) The TRHL schedule will provide for limited interleague play. In
interleague games, the DH rule will be used in AL parks and not used in
NL parks.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="rosters"></a> 3. Rosters<br>
<br>
a) The total roster size is limited to 50 players. This applies from
the beginning of the draft until the end of the playoffs. Off season
rosters are unlimited in size.<br>
<br>
b) From Opening Day to September 1 of a season , teams may only have 25
players on the active roster. The remaining players must either be on
the disabled list or farmed (minor leagues).<br>
<br>
c) On September 1 of a season, the active roster may be increased to 40.<br>
<br>
d) Active postseason roster size is 25. This roster must be submitted
by August 31st.<br>
<br>
e) Sometime between the end of the TRHL World Series and the annual
free agent draft (general target: January/February), teams must re-sign
those players they will be retaining for the upcoming year. The web page
will automate the process of re-signing players. This roster is known
as the winter roster.<br>
<br>
<a name="salaries"></a> 4. Player Salaries<br>
<br>
a) The total team salary at any time between the Free Agent Draft and
the end of the World Series must not exceed $400.<br>
<br>
b) At the end of the World Series, each player's salary will be
adjusted accordingly:<br>
<br>
1) Current salary + 15% (round up all fractional remainders).<br>
2) The minimum salary increase is $2.<br>
<br>
Example 1) Craig Biggio's previous salary is $56. $56 + .15(56) = 64.4
= $65 (note roundup) <br>
Example 2) Wendell Magee's previous salary is $4. $4 + .15(4) = 4.6 =
$6 (note $2 minimum increase) <br>
<br>
<a name="draft"></a> 5. Free Agent Draft<br>
<br>
a) At the beginning of each season, two weeks after the deadline for
re-signing players, a auction-style draft will be held for available
free agents. The free agent draft will be conducted over the TRHL Web
page. This draft will continue until all players that have been
nominated have been drafted and for 3 days no team chooses to nominate
further players.<br>
<br>
b) During the draft, salary cap and roster size restrictions must be
met. No team may submit a bid which will violate rules C3a or C4a.<br>
<br>
c) Any team (via the web page) may nominate any free agent not already
nominated (subject to C5b) at any time.<br>
<br>
d) Owners should recognize that around 5500 AB and 1300 IP will be
needed over the course of a season. At a minimum, teams must come out of
the draft with 4500 AB and 1000 IP.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="limits"></a> 6. Playing Time Limits<br>
<br>
a) Two limitations on playing time will be enforced, and EXCEEDING
either of them will require the player to be farmed for the remainder of
the regular season:<br>
<br>
1) a total limitation of 110%<br>
2) a limit of 150% vs. LH or vs. RH<br>
<br>
b) Rule C6a1 will apply to batters and pitchers alike.<br>
<br>
c) Rule C6a2 only applies to batters for that "armed" pitcher for which
they have the highest OPS (on-base % + slugging %) against.<br>
<br>
Example 1) Todd Hollandsworth has an OPS of .800 in 20 AB vs LH
pitching and a OPS of 750 in 300 ABs of RH pitching. He will be limited
to 30 ABs vs LH pitching.<br>
<br>
Example 2) Jermaine Allensworth has an OPS of .750 in 200 AB vs LH
pitching and a OPS of 800 in 300 ABs of RH pitching. He will be limited
to 450 ABs vs RH pitching.<br>
<br>
<br>
d) In the event of a shortened season in which fewer than the normal
162 games are played, the TRHL will play a 162-game season and the
player eligibility limits will be adjusted accordingly. These limits
will be defined by the League Office in advance of the Annual Free Agent
Draft.<br>
<br>
e) League managers are encouraged to investigate and report potential
violations of the usage rule. As with all TRHL matters, it is expected
that honesty will prevail with occasional unintentional oversights.<br>
<br>
f) In the playoffs, two limitations on playing time will be enforced,
and EXCEEDING either of them in a single post-season series will require
the player to be benched for the remainder of that series:<br>
<br>
1) a total limitation of 8%<br>
2) a limit of 12% vs. LH or vs. RH<br>
<br>
g) Rule C5f1 will apply to batters and pitchers alike.<br>
<br>
h) Rule C5f2 only applies to batters with less than 75 AB (vs. LH) or
300 AB (vs. RH) for that particular platoon split.<br>
<br>
i) The limits in Rule C5f will be increased 1% for each six extra
innings played.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="free agents"></a> 7. Free Agents, Player Releases<br>
<br>
a) Teams can release players at any time between the end of the draft
and the end of the World Series. Such players become free agents upon
their release and are immediately eligible to be signed by all teams
except the player's original club. The original club must wait a one
series period, before they can re-sign that player (presumably at a
lower price). <br>
<br>
b) Available free agents can be signed any time between the end of the
draft and the end of the World Series. Acquisition of free agents is
done via the web page. Teams will bid to acquire available free agents
on a series by series basis, with the free agent going to the highest
bidder.<br>
<br>
c) In the event of a tie bid, the team with the current worst record
will acquire the player.<br>
<br>
d) The salary of the acquired free agent shall be the bid itself or the
second highest bid plus $1, whichever is lower.<br>
<br>
<a name="trades"></a> 8. Trades<br>
<br>
a) Trades can occur any time except between the period: August 1st
(season time) and the end of the World Series.<br>
<br>
b) Trades should be entered at the TRHL Web Trade Page.<br>
<br>
c) All trades are subject to roster size and salary cap restrictions
(except during the off season).<br>
<br>
d) Roster cash cannot be exchanged as part of a trade.<br>
<br>
e) Players to be named later may not be components of a trade.<br>
<br>
<a name="farms"></a> 9. Farm Team (Reserve Roster)<br>
<br>
a) Players on a team roster but currently inactive comprise the farm
team.</p>
<p>b) There is no limit on the amount of times a player can be farmed
or promoted over the course of a season. However, on the third, and all
subsequent times a player is farmed during a season, any other team may
claim him at his current salary. For purposes of this rule, the first
time a player is farmed does not count, if it is done prior to the start
of the season, or if it is done immediately after he is acquired from
the free agent pool.<br>
<br>
c) Farm player's salaries do count against the salary cap. <br>
<br>
<a name="injuries"></a> 10. Injuries<br>
<br>
a) The TRHL will use the Actual option in DMB for generating injuries.<br>
<br>
b) When injured a player may be put onto the Disabled List. His stay on
the DL must be 15 days or the length of his injury, whichever is
greater. <br>
<br>
<a name="stadiums"></a>11.Stadiums<br>
<br>
a) Teams are not permitted to change stadiums during the course of a
season.<br>
<br>
b) Home stadium dimensions can be altered in the off season, but must
remain fixed from the beginning of the draft to the end of the World
Series. All stadium changes should be announced to the league via the
web page.<br>
<br>
<a name="playoffs"></a>12.Playoffs<br>
<br>
a) The three division winners make the playoffs as does one wild-card
team (best overall winning % by non-division winner) from each league.<br>
<br>
1) In the event of a tie for the division crown, a one game playoff
will be played to decide the pennant.<br>
2) Only eligible players as of the last day of the season are allowed
to play.<br>
<br>
b) The division winning team will be seeded 1-3 based on winning
percentage and the wild card team will be seeded 4th. 1 plays 4 and 2
plays 3 in the first round games.<br>
<br>
1) In the event of a tie, i) head to head records, (2 way ties only)<br>
ii) division records,<br>
iii) league records,<br>
iv) coin toss<br>
will be used in descending order to settle the seeding order.<br>
<br>
<br>
c) All series are best of 7 in a 2-3-2 format, with the lower seeded
team (1 is lowest) hosting the first 2 and last 2 games.<br>
<br>
d) In the World Series, the team with the most intra-league wins will
host games 1,2,6, &amp; 7. In need of tiebreaker, a coin toss will
determine home field. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<h3><a name="amendments"></a>E. Amendments </h3>
<p><a name="contracts"></a>1. Long Term Contracts </p>
<p> A team may sign zero, one or two players to a long term contract.
Contracted Players are retained for 2 years with no further salary
increase. The contracted player may be released at any time, but the
owning team will be penalized the amount of the contracted player's
normal salary increase (only the increase, not the entire salary) for
the remainder of the contract.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Any team which signed two players to long term contracts in the
preceding season, may not sign any in the current season. </p>
<p>Once the player's contract expires (third year with team), the
player becomes a free agent. His team may not retain him. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p><a name="minimum playing time"></a>2. Active Roster Minimum Playing
Time </p>
<p>Players who did not attain 25 plate appearances, if they are a
batter or 10 innings pitched, if they are a pitcher, may not appear on
the major league roster of a team in the TRHL.<br>
<br>
Players that do not meet these minimum requirements may be drafted, but
they may not be promoted to a team's active roster.<br>
